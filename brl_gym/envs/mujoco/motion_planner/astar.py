def astar_path(G, source, target, heuristic=None):
    """Return a list of nodes in a shortest path between source and target
    using the A* ("A-star") algorithm.

    There may be more than one shortest path.  This returns only one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    heuristic : function
       A function to evaluate the estimate of the distance
       from the a node to the target.  The function takes
       two nodes arguments and must return a number.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> print(nx.astar_path(G, 0, 4))
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> G = nx.grid_graph(dim=[3, 3])  # nodes are two-tuples (x,y)
    >>> nx.set_edge_attributes(G, {e: e[1][0]*2 for e in G.edges()}, 'cost')
    >>> def dist(a, b):
    ...    (x1, y1) = a
    ...    (x2, y2) = b
    ...    return ((x1 - x2) ** 2 + (y1 - y2) ** 2) ** 0.5
    >>> print(astar_path(G, (0, 0), (2, 2), heuristic=dist, weight='cost'))
